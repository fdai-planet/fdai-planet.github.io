                                        <h1>The Radius Gap</h1>


                                        <p> In 2017, the California Kepler Survey (<a style="color:blue" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1703.10375"> Fulton et al 2017</a>) revealed that small-planet radii follow a bimodal distribution (see below). One leading explanation is photoevaporation driven by high-energy radiation: EUV and X-rays heat planetary atmospheres and drive mass-loss outflows (<a style="color:blue" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1303.3899"> Owen and Wu 2013</a>,<a style="color:blue" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1305.0269"> Lopez and Fortney 2014</a>, <a style="color:blue" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1705.10810"> Owen and Wu 2017</a>). The lower peak of the distribution corresponds to rocky cores whose H/He envelopes have been completely stripped. Since stellar high-energy output declines after the first 100 Myr of the star's lifetime (<a style="color:blue" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...622..680R"> Ribas et al 2005</a>), larger planets with thicker envelopes may retain a few percent of H/He by the time photoevaporation shuts down. Even such thin envelopes are sufficient to inflate planetary radii, pushing them into the upper peak of the distribution.

                                        <p> An alternative explanation was proposed by <a style="color:blue" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1708.01621">Ginzburg et al 2017</a>: alone can drive significant atmospheric loss, thereby carving out the observed radius gap. <a style="color:blue" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1708.01621">Ginzburg et al 2017</a> further proposed that a simple way to distinguish 1) photoevaporation and 2) core-powered atmospheric loss is to examine the radius distribution across different stellar types. Since photoevaporation is powered by high-energy radiation, it should show a strong dependence on stellar type, as stars emit differing fractions of their energy at high energies. By contrast, core-powered mass loss should depend only on bolometric insolation (i.e., planetary equilibrium temperature) and thus be largely independent of stellar type.

The radius gap is also present in M dwarf planets indicating that whatever underlying process responsible for the radius gap for planets around sun-like stars must also operate for M dwarf planets.

                                        <p> To compare photoevaporation and core-powered mass loss, we examined the radius distribution of planets around M dwarfs, which are more active than Sun-like stars and emit a larger fraction of their energy in high-energy radiation. In our recent work (<a style="color:blue" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1710.03239">Hirano, Dai et al 2017 </a>), we reported 16 new planets around M dwarfs which represents a substantial addition to existing sample ~80 planets around M dwarf. Because spectroscopic parameters of M dwarfs are notoriously difficult to measure, we also carried out a uniform analysis of all known M-dwarf planets. The radius gap is clearly present in this population as well, indicating that the mechanism responsible must also operate for M-dwarf systems.

                         <p> We then investigated the location of the so-called “photoevaporation desert” which is a lack of planet between 2-4R⊕ at the highest insolation level. For Sun-ike the photoevaporation desert identified by  <a style="color:blue" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1604.05220"> Lundkvist et al 2016 </a> has a boundary at about 650 Earth insolation level F⊕.

                             <figcaption>The photoevaporation desert, i.e. a lack of planet between 2-4R⊕ at the highest insolation (larger than 650F⊕ for Sun-like stars), is shown in the grey box ( <a style="color:blue" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1604.05220"> Lundkvist et al 2016 </a>).

                         <p>


                         <p> We made similar plots for M-dwarf planets splitting between early M dwarf and mid-late M dwarfs (Teff = 3500K). Note that the blue box corresponds to the “photoevaporation desert” identified by <a style="color:blue" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1604.05220"> Lundkvist et al 2016 </a> around Sun-like stars. We can see that the “photoevaporation desert” occurs at a lower bolometric insolation level compared to Sun-like stars. In other words, M dwarfs seem to be more effective at reducing the size of their planets, a telltale sign that photoevaporation is the main driver for the radius gap. By contrast, if core-powered mass loss dominated, the desert would occur at the same bolometric insolation regardless of stellar type. This shift cannot be explained by selection effects, since closer-in, larger planets are easier to detect in transit surveys. Three notable outliers include HATS-6b and Kepler-45b, both hot Jupiters whose strong gravity suppresses efficient photoevaporation, and K2-33, a young (~10 Myr) system likely still undergoing atmospheric loss.
