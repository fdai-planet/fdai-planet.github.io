							<p>The <a style="color:blue" href="https://sfp.caltech.edu/programs/wavefellows">Caltech WAVE Program </a> is an undergraduate research program for the underrepresented minority students including racially minoritized communities, women, first-generation college students, geographically underrepresented students, educationally or financially disadvantaged students, and students with disabilities. I am fortunate enough to work Sarah Lange a smart, driven sophomore. Our project collected exoplanet radial velocity datasets scattered in the literature and put them in a Python package that is publicly available on Github(<a style="color:blue" href="github.com/California-Planet-Search/EZRV">github.com/California-Planet-Search/EZRV </a>) for easy access and population studies. At the end of our 12-week project, Sarah went from writing her first line of code to publishing her first Python package on Github. I am proud of Sarah. She is now a senior at UCSC; she is majoring in Physics and will continue to pursue her interest in exoplanets in Prof. Batalhaâ€™s group.</p>
