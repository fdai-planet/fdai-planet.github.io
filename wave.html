							<p>The <a style="color:blue" href="https://sfp.caltech.edu/programs/wavefellows">The <i>Caltech WAVE Program</i> </a>supports undergraduate research opportunities for students from underrepresented backgrounds, including racially minoritized communities, women, first-generation college students, geographically underrepresented students, educationally or financially disadvantaged students, and students with disabilities. Through this program, I had the privilege of working with Sarah Lange, a bright and driven sophomore. Together, we compiled exoplanet radial velocity datasets from the literature and developed a publicly available Python package, <a style="color:blue" href="https://github.com/California-Planet-Search/EZRV">EZRV</a>, to facilitate access and enable population studies. Over the course of our 12-week project, Sarah progressed from writing her very first lines of code to publishing her first Python package on GitHub. Sarah transferred to UCSC and majored in Physics after the program. She continued to explore her passion for exoplanet research in Prof. Batalhaâ€™s group.</p>
