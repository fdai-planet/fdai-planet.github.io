								<p>I grew up in Nanjing (南京), a city on the banks of the Yangtze River with recorded history dating back to at least 500 BC. At the age of 15, I received an SM1 Scholarship from the Ministry of Education of Singapore. The scholarship covered the tuition and living expenses while I studied for A-levels at Victoria Junior College (high school equivalent) in Singapore.</p>

                                <p>Although I had always been passionate about science, my interest in astronomy truly deepened after joining the Astronomy Club at Victoria Junior College. We often embarked on all-night <a style="color:blue" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_marathon">Messier marathons</a> with our 8-inch Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope. We also studied astronomy and physics together on a weekly basis and participated in <a style="color:blue" href="http://www.astrochallenge.org"> astronomy-related competitions</a>. </p>

                                    <p>I went to the University of Cambridge in UK as an undergrad in 2010. Thanks to the broad curriculum of the Natural Sciences Tripos, I also discovered interests in Geology and Evolutionary Biology. I vividly remember that we had the chance to examine one of ~100 <a style="color:blue" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_meteorite"> Martian meteorites</a> during a Geology class. The Martian origin of these meteorites was established by comparing the in-situ measurement from Mars rovers and the elemental and isotopic ratio of the minerals and gas inclusions in these meteorites. During another class in my sophomore year, I was absolutely astonished when I first learned about the theory of <a style="color:blue" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_dispersal"> "vegetation rafting"</a> that the ancestors of <a style="color:blue" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_monkey"> New World monkeys</a> had to sail from Africa to South America on a broken tree trunk! How did the trip begin: probably fleeing from predators? And how did the trip complete: by harnessing trade winds? I was fascinated by how something so improbable could happen given the equally unfathomable length of evolutionary timescales.

                                   I ultimately majored in Physics and graduated with First Class Honours, but my interests in astronomy, geology, and evolution converged in the interdisciplinary study of exoplanets. In 2014, I joined the MIT Department of Physics and the Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, where I began working on exoplanets with Prof. Saul Rappaport and my advisor, Prof. Josh Winn. When Josh moved to Princeton in 2016, I followed him and spent three years there as a visiting graduate student in the Department of Astrophysical Sciences. </p>

<p>After receiving my Ph.D in Physics from MIT in 2019, I was awarded the GPS Chair's Fellowship from the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences at Caltech. Two years later, I was fortunate enough to be awarded a NASA Sagan Fellowship to continue my research at Caltech with <a style="color:blue" href="https://exoplanets.caltech.edu/about-andrew/"> Prof. Andrew Howard</a> and <a style="color:blue" href="https://www.heatherknutson.org"> Prof. Heather Knutson</a>, and others. </p>


<p>I joined the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawai`i as a faculty member in 2024.</p>
